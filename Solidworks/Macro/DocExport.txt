INTRODUCTION:

For use with SolidWorks Models:
  DocExport.swp permits a user to export selected configurations of the current 
  SolidWorks model to different file types. This is useful when you need to 
  separate many configurations into individual files of another file type for a 
  vendor to use/reference.  This macro works by displaying a selection list of 
  configurations in the current SolidWorks model, then the user can select the 
  configurations and the export file type.  

For use with SolidWorks Drawings:
  DocExport.swp permits a user to export selected drawing sheets of the current 
  SolidWorks drawing to a different file type. This is useful when you need to 
  send a drawing to a vendor to use/reference and thry don't have SolidWorks. 
  This macro works by displaying a selection list of drawing sheets in the 
  current SolidWorks drawing, then the user can select the drawing sheets and 
  the export file type.  

Batch Mode (when no documet is loaded in SolidWorks)
  All documents (parts, assemblies, and drawings) will be found dna displayed to 
  the user.  The user can then select the documents and export types.  During 
  processing, all configurations and sheets will be exported.

During the export process
  The export file name will appear in the status bar at the bottom of the form, 
  the document will be regenerated on the screen, and the exported file will be 
  created.  The exported files will be created in the same directory the current 
  document was loaded from.
